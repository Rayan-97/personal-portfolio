            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Mohammad Rayan, a dedicated and enthusiastic web developer who is passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences. My journey in web development began with a curiosity about how websites work, and it has evolved into a genuine passion for crafting clean, accessible, and user-friendly web solutions.</p>
            
            <p>I believe that good web development is not just about writing code, but about understanding user needs and creating solutions that make people's lives easier. I'm constantly learning new technologies and best practices to stay current in this ever-evolving field.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about web development trends, or working on personal projects that challenge me to grow as a developer. I'm always excited about new opportunities to collaborate and create something amazing together.</p>
